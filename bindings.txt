#? TTY

## TTY has an an input driver to manage terminal job control - it recognizes certain key sequences as special signals
stty -a ## print bindings
stty intr ^c ## bind ^c as interruption signal
stty susp ^z ## bind ^z as suspend signal
## put commands in bashrc to make changes permanent

#? BASH

## bash, like python or mysql cli, uses readline, a unix library that provides comand-line-editing capabilities
## readline supports emacs and vi keybindings, history management, auto-completion and keyboard shortcuts
.bashrc ## bash configuration
.inputrc ## readline configuration
## readline configuration can be changed in bash with the command bind

## bash

set -o vi ## enable vi-mode of bash

bind -l ## list functions in alphabetical order
bind -p ## list functions in alphabetical order with their bindings
bind -v ## list variables and their values

bind 'C-l clear-screen' ## change a readline function binding
bind 'set editing-mode vi' ## change a readline variable value

bind -m vi-insert 'C-l clear-screen' ## set mode-specific binding
bind -m vi-mode -p ## list mode-specific function bindings

bind -r C-l ## remove binding
bind -m vi-command -r C-l ## remove binding in specific mode

bind -f ~/.inputrc ## reload config file

## readline

C-l clear-screen ## change a function binding
"cl" clear-screen ## sequences of keys need quotes
"\t" clear-screen ## special keys need quotes
set editing-mode vi ## change a value

C-l "Hello, World!" ## key to write something in the terminal
C-l "ls -lA\n" ## key to execute a command
"ciw" "bce" ## vim-style command

C-l "" ## unbind key

## bindings by default are in global mode - they work both in insert mode and normal mode
## mode-specific bindings override global bindings
set keymap vi-command ## every following binding works only in normal mode
set keymap vi-insert ## every following binding works only in insert mode
set keymap vi-move ## every following binding works only in move mode

#? TMUX

c-u ? ## see bindings
c-u / ## test binding
.tmux.conf ## custom bindings
