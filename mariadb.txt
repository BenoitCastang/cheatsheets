sudo apt install mariadb-server ## install mariadb
sudo systemctl enable --now mariadb ## enable and start mariadb
sudo mysql_secure_installation ## set password for root

#? CONFIG

/etc/mysql ## mariadb main config directory
/etc/mysql/mariadb.cnf ## global defaults

#? MANAGING DATABASES

## mariadb uses its own internal users, seperate from the Linux system users
mariadb -u root -p ## connect with user root - prompted for password
mariadb -u root -ppassword ## connect with user root with password clear - not secure
sudo mariadb ## connect with user root without password

## user management requires being logged in as root
FLUSH PRIVILEGES; ## reload privileges information - to do after each change

CREATE USER toast; ## create user
CREATE USER 'toast'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY ''; ## equivalent to CREATE USER toast
## @ represents allowed hosts: ip adress, localhost, or % for all hosts
## IDENTIFIED BY represents the password: '' is no password
CREATE USER 'user'@'localhost'; ## create user allowing connection for sole localhost: one must be connected to the server itself to connect to mariadb
CREATE USER 'user'@'%'; ## allow connection from everywhere
CREATE USER 'user'@'192.168.0.%'; ## allow connection from only 192.168.0.XXX network
CREATE USER user IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; set a password

SELECT HOST, USER, PASSWORD FROM mysql.user; ## print list of users
DROP USER toast; ## delete user

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'user'@'localhost'; ## give access to all databases and all tables of these databases to user
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; ## create user at the same time
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database.* TO 'user'@'localhost'; ## give rights to one database only
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database.table TO 'user'@'localhost'; ## give rights to one table from one database only
GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'user'@'localhost'; ## give select rights only
GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'user'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'user'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'user'@'localhost';

SHOW GRANTS; ## print all permissions
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'user'@'localhost'; ## print user rights
SELECT user,host from mysql.user; ## print all users
