## OpenSSL - open secure sockets layer
## toolkit and library for working with SSL and TLS, which are protocols that secure communications over a network between client and server
## provides secured protocols: https, pop3s, imaps, ftps, smtps etc.
## provides encryption, decryption, certificate handling, key generation features
## usable as code library or command-line utility

## divided in 3 three components
libcrypto ## the core cryptographic library to handle symmetric and asymmetric encryptions, hashing and random number generations
libssl ## SSL/TLS implementation to handle handshake, certificate validation and secure communication
## SSL - Secure Sockets Layer
## TLS - Transport Layer Security
openssl ## the command-line tool - interface to test, debug and manage ssl/tls operations and certificates

openssl s_client -connect localhost:https ## connect a https port
