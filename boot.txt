## The Linux boot process can be split into three main steps:
## 1.The workstation firmware starts, performing a quick check of the hardware, called a Power-On Self Test (POST), and then it looks for a bootloader program to run from a bootable device
## 2.The bootloader runs and determines what Linux kernel program to load
## 3.The kernel program loads into memory and starts the necessary background programs required for the system to operate

dmesg ## read the kernel ring buffer
## the kernel ring buffer logs the boot messages
## it is circular and set to a predetermined size: as new messages are logged into the buffer, older messages are rotated out
/var/log ## boot messages are also logged the /var/log folder, where files store the messages of individual previous boots

/boot/grub/grub.cfg ## grub configuration
