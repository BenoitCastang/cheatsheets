#? IPTABLES

## iptables allows to control network traffic by defining rules

## tables: sets of rules grouped by purpose
  ## filter - the default table, used for accepting/denying traffic
  ## nat -  stands for network address translation (like redirecting ports)
  ## mangle - for packet alteration
  ## raw - for advanced packet flow control
## chains: predefined paths in the kernel that packets pass through
  ## input - traffic to the machine
  ## output - traffic through the machine (like a router)
  ## forward - traffic from the machine
  ## prerouting -
  ## postrouting -
## rules: decisions about the traffic
  ## allow -
  ## drop -
  ## reject -
  ## log -

iptables -L ## list rules
iptables -L -t nat ## select table - default is filter
iptables -L INPUT ## select input chain only

iptables -v ## verbose: adds bytes, in and out fields
iptables -n ## no name resolution

## rules apply in order (top to bottom)
## if no rule matches , the default policy applies
iptables -P INPUT DROP ## change policy
