cat /etc/os-release ## show current linux system info
uname -a ## show current linux system info
hostnamectl status ## show hostname and system info
neofetch ## print system info

lscpu ## display processor info
lsblk ## display disks and partitions

uptime ## state of the host ## The three last digits indicate the systemâ€™s load average for the last minute, the last five minutes and the last fifteen minutes, respectively. Each of these numbers indicates how many processes were waiting either for CPU resources or for input/output operations to complete. This means that these processes were ready to run if they had received the respective resources.

load average ## series of numbers representing the server's trend in CPU utilization
cat /proc/loadavg ## see load average
0.36, 0.39, 0.31 ## typical load average - for last minute, last 5 minutes and last 15 minutes
## the number of cpu is the 100% usage: if the server has 4 cpus virtual included, a load average of 4 is 100% usage for the given time period

top ## Dynamic display running processes
htop ## colored and fancier version
u ## filter by user
t ## tree view of processes
htop -d 10 ## call htop with refresh every second - default is 20, every two seconds

#? FREE

free ## show ram usage
free -b ## Bytes
free -m ## Mebibytes
free -g ## Gibibytes
free -h ## human-readable format
total ## total amount of memory installed on the server
used ## memory not being used by anything, neither shared or buffers or cache
free ## memory not being used by anything
shared ## memory being used by tmpfs and other shared resources
buff/cache ## memory used by the buffers and cache
available ## memory free for applications to use

#? SWAP

## create a swap file

swap ## file in hard disk that acts like ram when server's memory is saturated - present by default in most systems
/etc/fstab ## see if swap is present

sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile ## create a 4G file
sudo chmod 0600 /swapfile ## set least permissions possible
sudo mkswap /swapfile ## make it a swap file
/swapfile none swap sw 0 0 ## fstab line to add
sudo swapon -a ## activate swap file (mount and activate it from /etc/fstab)
sudo swapoff -a ## deactivates swap file

## swapiness value indicate how frequently Linux utilizes swap - default is 60, meaning swap is used when approximately 60% ram is used
cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness ## see swapiness value
sudo sysctl vm.swapiness=30 ## temporarily change swapiness value
/etc/sysctl.conf ## add vm.swapiness=30 to this file for permanent change
