## search a pattern and return lines matching it - works with stdin and files
grep foo ## search pattern in stdin, here user input
ls -l | grep foo ## search pattern in stdin, here redirected command output
grep foo <files> ## search pattern in file

grep -v ## reverted grep, show no match entries
grep -c ## display only number of matches
grep -i ## ignore case
grep -r ## recursive
grep -l ## show file name only, the line line matching the pattern
grep -L ## show file name when not matchin
grep -c ## show number of matches per file
grep -n ## show line numbers with matches
grep -w ## match whole word only
grep -x ## match whole line
grep -A 2 ## after context: show two lines of the file afer each match
grep -B 2 ## before context: show two lines of the file before each match
grep -C 2 ## context: show two lines of the file around each match
grep -o ## show only matching part of each line
grep -e pattern1 -e pattern2 ## specify multiple patterns, search pattern1 or pattern2
grep -q ## quiet, no output and returns 0 if match is found, 1 if not

grep ^blop ## if line begins with blop
grep crac$ ## if line ends with crac
grep ^flop$ ## if the entire line is exactly flop
grep ^fl.*op$ ## if line is fl then any character any number of times then op

## escape needed
grep "crac\|plouf" ## match crac or plouf

. ## matches any single character
[] ## matches any character withing the brackets
[^abc] ## doesnt match characters within the brackets

* ## previous character can be present any number or times
+ ## previous character must be present at least one time
? ## previous character must be not present or present only one time
{n} ## previous character must be present exactly n times
{n,} ## previous character must be present n or more times
{n,m} ## previous character must be present between n and m times

## extended regex
grep -E "crac|blop" ## crac or blop
grep -E "file(1|2)" ## file1 or file2
